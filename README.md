1. **Building an Agent with LangGraph**
   - Learn how to create AI agents using LangGraph framework

2. **Document Q&A with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
   - Implement a question-answering system using retrieval-augmented generation techniques

3. **Embeddings and Similarity Scores**
   - Work with text embeddings and calculate similarity scores between documents

4. **Evaluation and Structured Output**
   - Techniques for evaluating model outputs and generating structured responses

5. **Fine-tuning a Custom Model**
   - Hands-on guide to fine-tuning generative AI models for specific tasks

6. **Function Calling with the Gemini API**
   - Learn how to use function calling capabilities with Google's Gemini API

7. **Google Search Grounding**
   - Implement search grounding techniques to enhance model responses with web search

8. **Prompting Techniques**
   - Explore various prompting strategies for better model outputs

9. **Classifying Embeddings with Keras**
   - Use Keras to build classification models based on text embeddings
