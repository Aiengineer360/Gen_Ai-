       "Based on the document you provided, here's a breakdown of the training process used for Gemini 1.5 Pro:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Model Architecture:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Gemini 1.5 Pro is a **sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) Transformer-based model.** This means it builds upon the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) but incorporates a MoE structure.\n",
       "*   MoE models use a **learned routing function** to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters for processing. This allows the model to have a large total parameter count while only activating a portion of those parameters for any given input.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Training Data:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   The model is trained on a **variety of multimodal and multilingual data.**\n",
       "*   The pre-training dataset includes data sourced from many different domains, including **web documents, code, images, audio, and video content.**\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Training Infrastructure:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Gemini 1.5 Pro is trained on **multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators**, distributed across multiple datacenters.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Training Process:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Pre-training:** The model is initially pre-trained on the large, diverse dataset mentioned above.\n",
       "*   **Instruction Tuning:** After pre-training, Gemini 1.5 Pro is fine-tuned on a collection of multimodal data containing paired instructions and appropriate responses.\n",
       "*   **Human Preference Tuning:** Further tuning is performed based on human preference data.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Aspects and Innovations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Long Context Understanding:** A series of significant architecture changes enable long-context understanding of inputs up to 10 million tokens without degrading performance.\n",
       "*   **Efficiency:** Improvements across the entire model stack (architecture, data, optimization, and systems) allow Gemini 1.5 Pro to achieve comparable quality to Gemini 1.0 Ultra while using significantly less training compute and being significantly more efficient to serve.\n",
       "*   **Multimodality:** The model is natively multimodal and supports interleaving of data from different modalities (audio, visual, text, code) in the same input sequence.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the training process involves a combination of large-scale pre-training on diverse multimodal data, followed by instruction tuning and human preference tuning, all leveraging a MoE architecture and Google's TPU infrastructure. A key focus is on enabling the model to handle extremely long contexts effectively.\n"

       "Okay, I can explain the training process of a large language model like Gemini 1.5 Pro in a way that a 5-year-old can understand.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imagine you have a puppy, and you want to teach it to understand and follow your instructions.\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Lots and Lots of Examples:** First, you show the puppy many, many examples of things you want it to learn. For example, you show it pictures of cats and say \"cat,\" pictures of dogs and say \"dog,\" and so on. You also read it lots of stories and talk to it all the time. The puppy is like the computer model, and all the pictures, stories, and conversations are the training data.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Learning the Patterns:** The puppy starts to notice patterns. It sees that cats have pointy ears and whiskers, and dogs have floppy ears and wagging tails. It also learns that certain words go together, like \"good\" and \"boy.\" The computer model does the same thing. It looks for patterns in the training data and learns how words, images, and sounds are related.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Making Predictions:** Now, you show the puppy a new picture, and you ask, \"What's this?\" The puppy tries to guess based on what it has learned. If it says \"cat\" when it sees a cat, that's good! If it says \"dog,\" you gently correct it. The computer model also makes predictions. It might try to guess the next word in a sentence or answer a question about a picture.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Getting Better and Better:** Every time the puppy makes a mistake, you help it learn from that mistake. You give it feedback so it can do better next time. The computer model also gets feedback. It adjusts its internal settings to make better predictions in the future. This process is repeated over and over again, with more and more examples, until the puppy (or the computer model) becomes very good at understanding and following instructions.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, in short, training a large language model is like teaching a puppy: you show it lots of examples, it learns the patterns, it makes predictions, and it gets better and better with feedback. The more examples you give it, the smarter it becomes!\n",

    "\n",
    "### LLM limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n",
